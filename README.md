# Peabody's Advent of Code 2022 solutions

This is my collection of advent of code solutions and corresponding puzzle files.

I did everything in Python.

A lot of the code is messy and uncommented. I was merely throwing it together to get my solution.

I don't promise that any of this stuff works or that it would be good code to review to help someone with Advent of Code :).

Conventions:

ax-y.py - Solution for day x part y.
px.txt - Puzzle file for day x
px-ex.txt - Example puzzle file from problem text for testing
